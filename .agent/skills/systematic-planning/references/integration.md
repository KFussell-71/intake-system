# Integration Guide

## Using with Git

Before committing, ensure your planning files are up to date. You can include them in your commits to provide historical context for your work.

## Using with UI Skills

When designing interfaces, use `findings.md` to document accessibility audits, color contrast ratios, and user testing feedback.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Planning files serve as the "shared mental model" for different agents working on the same codebase. Always read the plan before starting a sub-task.
